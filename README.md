# HandShake

A deal making application for the modern age

```
Download the project and run npm install in the components listed below

I don't really know what you'll do since I haven't set up other aws accounts to use my resoureces
```

## Project is broken up into 2 components


### 1. handshake-api: 
Guess what this one does.  If you guessed interfacing with AWS's APIs, then you guessed right.
  
#### Facts:
* Hosted on its own node-server
* Written in javascript
* Doesn't do anything particularly interesting yet
  
### 2. handshake-ui:
Who'd have thought that you would need, or really want, to see your website.

#### Facts:
* Definitely written by a novice UI developer
* Has a couple of cute automated html-generating functions
* Used a couple of Vanilla JavaScript framework features. Very nice.
